    "poem1": "I am from chemicals,\nFrom sulfuric and mercuric.\nI am from the mud after a fresh Austin rain.\nI am from the oak tree, its pollen and fallen leaves\nIts arms stretching for all to climb.\n\nI am from the weather\nFrom blizzards to light rain.\nIâ€™m from the lizards, crawling on the porch\n\tAnd the coyotes calling in the night.\n\nI am from the frozen chili, brought from Hawaii\nAnd the bags of rice brought by my mother.\n\nI am from the grape smell of mountain laurel, fresh in the spring and summer\nFrom the newly grown grass to the bamboo in my backyard.\nI am from the smell of barbeque, drifting from the roadside.\nI am from the fresh rice prepared by my mom.\nI am from the blueberry in the pile of raspberries.",
    "poem2": "Who am I?\nI am the defenestrator of paper,\na multi-instrumentalist,\nwith a great allure to rice, a connoisseur,\na buff of the culinary bounty, A devotee to dining",
    "poem3": "As fire fades beneath the horizon's glow,\nBurdens laden, day's weight grows as shadows.\nCrimson hues cast themselves upon the clouds\nDying light brings closure to memories\nEncapsulated, entombed in the mind\nForgetting details, smoothing the brain\nGrain by grain\nLosing consciousness."
